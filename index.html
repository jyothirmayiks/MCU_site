    <h2>A Universe of Heroes</h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe">Marvel Cinematic Universe
        (MCU)</a> is an American media franchise and shared universe centered on a series of superhero films produced by
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Studios">Marvel Studios</a>.
      The films are based on characters that appear in American comic books published by <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics">Marvel Comics</a>.
      The franchise also includes several television series, short films, digital series, and literature. The shared
      universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot
      elements, settings, cast, and characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marvel Studios releases its films in groups called "Phases", with the first three phases collectively known as <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Infinity_Saga">"The Infinity Saga"</a> and the
      following three phases as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Multiverse_Saga">"The
        Multiverse Saga"</a>.
      The first MCU film, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man_(2008_film)">Iron Man
        (2008)</a>, began Phase One which culminated in the 2012 crossover film <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(2012_film)">The Avengers</a>.
      Phase Two began with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man_3">Iron Man 3 (2013)</a>
      and concluded with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant-Man_(film)">Ant-Man (2015)</a>,
      while Phase Three began with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America:_Civil_War">Captain America:
        Civil War (2016)</a> and concluded with <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Far_From_Home">Spider-Man: Far From Home
        (2019)</a>.
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Widow_(2021_film)">Black Widow (2021)</a> is the
      first film in Phase Four, which concluded with <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther:_Wakanda_Forever">Black Panther: Wakanda
        Forever (2022)</a>, while Phase Five began with <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant-Man_and_the_Wasp:_Quantumania">Ant-Man and the Wasp:
        Quantumania (2023)</a> and will conclude with <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolts_(film)">Thunderbolts (2025)</a>.
      Phase Six will begin with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Four_in_film">The
        Fantastic Four: First Steps (2025)</a> and it will conclude with <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers:_The_Kang_Dynasty">Avengers: Doomsday (2026)</a>
      and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers:_Secret_Wars">Avengers: Secret Wars
        (2027)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marvel Television expanded the universe to network television with <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agents_of_S.H.I.E.L.D.">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> on ABC
      in 2013 before further expanding to streaming television on Netflix and Hulu and to cable television on Freeform.
      They also produced the digital series <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agents_of_S.H.I.E.L.D.:_Slingshot">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot
        (2016)</a>.
      Marvel Studios began producing their own television series for streaming on Disney+, starting with <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WandaVision">WandaVision</a> in 2021 as the beginning of
      Phase Four.
      That phase also saw the studio expand to television specials, known as Marvel Studios Special Presentations,
      starting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolf_by_Night_(TV_special)">Werewolf by
        Night (2022)</a>.
      The MCU includes various tie-in comics published by Marvel Comics, a series of direct-to-video short films called
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_One-Shots">Marvel One-Shots</a> from 2011 to 2014,
      and viral marketing campaigns for some films featuring the faux news programs WHIH Newsfront (2015–16) and The
      Daily Bugle
      (2019–2022).

    </p>
    <p>
      The franchise has been commercially successful, becoming one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time,
      and it has received generally positive reviews from critics. The studio attributed several Multiverse Saga
      projects performing below expectations to the increase in the amount of content being produced after the 2019 film
      Avengers: Endgame, and began decreasing its content output from 2024. The MCU has inspired other film and
      television studios to attempt similar shared universes and has also inspired several themed attractions, an art
      exhibit, television specials, literary material, multiple tie-in video games, and commercials.
